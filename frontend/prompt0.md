You must follow ALL of these rules:

Do NOT modify any logic, event handlers, state variables, hooks, effect deps, function signatures, prop names, or prop types.

Do NOT rename any existing component files, variables, or props.

Do NOT remove microphone / voice / recording functionality. Do NOT change anything related to audio capture, audio streaming, WebRTC, Web Audio API, or speech logic.

Do NOT add new dependencies other than Tailwind classes and minimal inline JSX.

You may only change JSX structure/markup and Tailwind classes to improve layout, spacing, colors, borders, typography, and animations.

Keep component exports default/named exactly the same.

Keep all conditional rendering logic exactly the same.

The style direction is: modern, calm, minimal, high-clarity, high-legibility, subtle depth, soft rounded corners, subtle shadows, slightly warm dark theme (not pure black).

The UI must be responsive and mobile-first. Use flex, grid, gap, max-w, overflow handling, etc.

For animations, use Tailwind utility classes like transition, duration-300, hover:scale-[1.02], animate-pulse, basic keyframes if needed. No external animation libs.

If any of these rules conflict with your suggestion, you will follow the rules and NOT your suggestion.
